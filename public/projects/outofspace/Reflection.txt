Mazoun:
My experience during the "Out of Space" festival this week was unique compared to my peers because I could only attend in person for one day due to illness. However, I remained engaged by working remotely for the rest of the days. Despite the limited time I had, I made an effort to actively participate in the activities and contribute to my team's project. It was evident that there were challenges related to clear instructions and schedules throughout the week. Nevertheless, I appreciated the opportunity to be part of this creative endeavor in the field of media design, even if my physical presence was limited to just one day. I particularly loved the astronaut's talk; it was unexpectedly interesting and enlightening.
