We made use of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and MySQL. Mazoun was our team leader in this project. It was always special to see how Mazoun got a group of people on board for her ideas, even when some people didn't seem to agree in the first place. She really brought everyone together, making use of everyone's personal strengths. Making clear to-do list and professional documents. Mazoun would be an amazing addition to any team.",
